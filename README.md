The goal of this project is to provide assistance to students who have completed a semester of Python ([`CISC131`](https://github.com/MercyCollegeCS/CISC131)) as they prepare for the Java programming language class (`CISC231`). While this project is primarily intended for this specific audience, it may also be a useful resource for those interested in learning more about Java.

To aid in the learning process, this project begins with Python examples and then demonstrates how to implement the same examples in Java, while also comparing the strengths, weaknesses, and differences between the two languages. It should be noted that this repository does not seek to replace comprehensive Java reference materials or courses.

# Outlines
The project is organized into four units:

- Unit 01: Variables, Inputs and Outputs
- Unit 02: Conditionals
- Unit 03: Loops
- Unit 04: Functions

# Testing Environment
The project is designed to be used with the following software versions:
- `Python`: `3.10`
- `Java`: `JDK 17`

Since 2022
