## Goal
The goal of this project is to help students who have had one semester of Python ([`CISC131`](https://github.com/MercyCollegeCS/CISC131)) prepare the Java programming language class (`CISC231`). 

If you are not a part of that audience, you may still find this a useful way to learn about Java. To help student to learn Java I will start with a Python example and then implement the example in Java. Along the way we will examine the strengths, weaknesses, and differences between those two languages. Again, this repo does not attempt to replace the many good Java reference books or any Java courses.

## Outline
- `Unit 01`: Variables, Inputs and Outputs
- `Unit 02`: Conditionals
- `Unit 03`: Loops
- `Unit 04`: Functions

## Test Environment
- `Python`: `3.10`
- `Java`: `JDK 17`
